# About me:

My name is Nathan and I am a 17 year old Computer Science A-Level student at college and I also did Computer Science at GCSE for 5 years. My main long term goal with Computer Science is that I eventually want to enter the game development field, even if just as a hobby, as my main interest within Computer Science is programming. I have used Python, C, Java, HTML, and I am using C# for my solo A-Level Coursework which I and currently working on and have chosen to be to create a Dungeon Crawler style game. I have also completed programming projects across the course in groups, which has made helped with teamwork and communication. I would be happy to start out as a solo game developer, but if I were to join a bigger company I would ideally like to have a role directly linked to the development of the code.
